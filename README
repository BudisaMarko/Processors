This is a Django project for providing small
web services that swallow XML (by URL or upload)
in the XSAMS format for atomic and molecular
data, and do something useful with it.

The directory processors/ holds the settings
files and deploy examples, plus tha main urls.py

The applyXSL app transforms the input with XSL.
One installation can serve an arbitrary number
of sheets as processors, simply add the name
and output type to XSL_MIME in applyXSL/views.py.
You might need to create the directory
static/results/ where the conversion output is
saved and cached.

The specynth app returns spectra in json format.
